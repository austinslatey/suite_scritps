# Substitution Issue

Currently I have a problem that I may need to write a script for in NetSuite

## Tech Stack
- Shopify
- NetSuite Connector (Far App)
- NetSuite

## Problem Statement
Currently I have two different part numbers inside of Shopify, and I would like one of those part-numbers to be automatically converted to a different part-number once it's purchased and lands in netsuite.


#### Why
There is much more traffic on one part number than the other but the one that has more traffic is not provided by that specific manufacturer anymore... I would like to keep the 'not provided by the specific manufacturer anymore' so I don't delete the SEO that is tied to it.  

The other part-number is the same it's just made by a different manufacturer.
This is the reason I dont want to remove the first number all together, but re-route it to the other part-number that recieves less traffic in NetSuite.

simplified: two part numbers in Shopify, rerouted to the same part number in netsuite.

## Resolution
