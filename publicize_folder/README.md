Found a way to upload an entire folder to NetSuite and allow all files within that folder to be public upon upload with ease.

1. Create a zip folder of all the images/files you plan to make public documents.
2. Navigate to the `Documents` Dashboard by clicking on Documents and create or navigate to an existing folder you intend to store the files.
    If you do not have a folder where you want these files to be uploaded I suggest creating a new folder for organization (eg. Altec_assets, Westin_assets, etc.)
3. After having a folder location in mind, Click the button `Advanced Add` This will open up a new form for you to customize. 
4. Upload the zip file
5. Select the checkbox option `Make all Files Available Without Login` and ensure `Unzip files` is also selected.

That's it you are done, files will be available via public URL. (Will create new write-up to list all Public URL's once I have more information)
This should help the syncronization image deletion error for good.
